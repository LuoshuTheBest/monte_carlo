The input file is: test.angs
The simulation will have 100000 trial steps
Each step consists of a backbone move followed by 5 sidechain moves
Each backbone move consists of changing 1 backbone angles with a StDev of 10
Each rotamer move consists of changing 1 rotamers selected at random.
The temperature of the simulation is 298.15
Intermediate results will be saved every 1000 trial backbone steps
Only final output will be saved in the current directory
The random seed is 0
